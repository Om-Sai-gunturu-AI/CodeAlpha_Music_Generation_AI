# Music Generation with AI

This project uses deep learning to generate original music using MIDI datasets. It leverages LSTM networks to train on sequences of notes and generate new compositions.

## Features
- Parse MIDI files into sequences of notes.
- Train an LSTM model to learn patterns in the music.
- Generate new music and save it as a MIDI file.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-generation.git
   cd music-generation
